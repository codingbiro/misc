These earbuds have exceeded my expectations in every way. Here's why I think they are a fantastic choice:\n\nType-C Compatibility: The addition of Type-C connectivity is a game-changer.

I love the conversation Awareness feature vs. transparency mode. Battery life is good during my usage of conversation awareness, noise canceling, and default settings. Mic and noise canceling feels great when talking to someone or even being on the other end. So far pretty solid for general use cases and gym but would love to see about different equalizers. Connectivity is pretty fast through all apple products and even when connecting to Windows Bluetooth is seamless. Another great feature is the small sounds of charging the device and finding it.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5,"bestRating":5},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Best Buy"}},{"@type":"Review","name":"Really good product","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Hanna"},"reviewBody":"I have an Android phone, and I have tried a bunch of noise canceling earbuds, from lower end ones with crappy noise canceling, up to the Pixel Buds 2 and Bose QuietComfort II, and I returned them all. I have small ears, and most wouldn't stay in my ears or they hurt, even with alternate eartips. The Bose fit great but wouldn't stay connected to my devices (a known issue). I also have an iPad, so I gave in and bought the AirPods. They fit perfectly, don't fall out of my ears, are comfortable for hours, paired and worked perfectly with my iPad, and the noise canceling is excellent. I love the conversation awareness setting that lowers the volume of your media and enhances voices in front of you if you speak. And in transparency mode, you don't have to take them out to hear other people clearly. They also work just fine with my Android phone.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5,"bestRating":5},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Best Buy"}},{"@type":"Review","name":"WORTH EVERY PENNY","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Hashi"},"reviewBody":"I recently got my hands on the Apple AirPods Pro 2nd generation, and they've exceeded my expectations! The audio quality is outstanding, especially with the active noise cancellation that truly enhances the listening experience. The sleek design and improved battery life make them perfect for on-the-go use. I love how they seamlessly integrate with my Apple devices, and the spatial audio feature adds a new dimension to my music. Yes, they come with a higher price tag, but the performance and innovation make the AirPods Pro 2 a worthwhile investment for any audio enthusiast like me!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5,"bestRating":5},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Best Buy"}},{"@type":"Review","name":"Best wireless earbuds","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Matt91"},"reviewBody":"I had never tried out the airpods max before and to be completely honest I never liked the stem design so I was extremely reluctant to even give them a try. After watching a few reviews I decided to give them a shot and all I have to say is “WOW!!!” Literally the best wireless ear buds ever, sound quality is amazing, it has the best noice cancellation I’ve ever experienced and it has phenomenal ambient mode as well! Still don’t like how the stem looks but it’s a small trade off for such an amazing pair of earbuds!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5,"bestRating":5},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Best Buy"}},{"@type":"Review","name":"Highly recommended","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"LesA"},"reviewBody":"These are amazing. I was a bit hesitant after trying out the 1st gen pros and being underwhelmed by the sound quality, but these have better bass, better sound, and great noise canceling/transparency. I use these everyday for work (great for when you have to read in a busy area) and the gym (ANC is really nice for the gym, helps me feel more focused). Spatial audio is game changing as well; have since switched over to Apple Music from Spotify for better overall audio quality. Admittedly expensive at MSRP, but for $189 these felt like a steal. Even at full price, these are worth the leap. Great to have USB-C as well.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5,"bestRating":5},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Best Buy"}},{"@type":"Review","name":"Great New Gen","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"LuzesmeraldaG"},"reviewBody":"My personal opinion these earbuds are perfect for anyone on a busy schedule. Having the option to have regular audio or having audio that detects when you are speaking , so the music lowers itself to a respectable volume which is great in my case as a mother of 4 who loves her show time. Also, the case is pretty cool actually although it’s exactly the same as the pods previously, these actually indicate when the have been connected to the charger aswell as having a little hoop section where you can add a cord, instead of buying a travel case with a chain.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5,"bestRating":5},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Best Buy"}}],"offers":{"@type":"AggregateOffer","priceCurrency":"USD","seller":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Best Buy"},"lowPrice":"179.99","highPrice":"199.99","offercount":2,"offers":[{"@type":"Offer","priceCurrency":"USD","price":"199.99","availability":"http://schema.org/InStock","itemCondition":"http://schema.org/NewCondition","description":"New"},{"@type":"Offer","priceCurrency":"USD","price":"179.99","availability":"http://schema.org/InStock","itemCondition":"http://schema.org/UsedCondition","description":"Refurbished"}]}}</script>
